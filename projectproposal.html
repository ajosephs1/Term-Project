    <h1>Barter</h1>
    <h2>What is your Website about?</h2>
    <p>
      This website will be a trading website that will allow Babson students or
      nearby college students/ youth to exchage items or "Barter credit" for
      other items such as furniture clothing or books.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <p>
      The object of this website is to have a page where students can easily
      find items in a social college community rather than having to look for
      more expensive alternatives online. This will allow for more for
      convenience for the college shopper as they could socialize with possible
      traders to assure quality. Mitigate the amount of waste usually seen at
      the end of the year as people move back home.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is your target audience</h2>
    <p>
      My target audienced is mainly college youth residing on Babson Campus or
      nearby universities but could also include short term tenants or people in
      nearby neighbourhoods who think they have something valuable to offer to
      the community.
